# Summary about datset

The dataset contains transactional and outlet information for various retail items. 
It includes product attributes (such as item type, fat content, weight, and visibility) and outlet characteristics (like type, size, location tier, and establishment year), along with sales and customer ratings. 
The data is a mix of categorical and numerical variables, suitable for sales analysis, product performance evaluation, and outlet-level insights.

## Key Observations:

Product fat content shows inconsistent formatting (e.g., “Low Fat” vs “low fat”) that may require cleaning.

Item visibility is represented as a small fractional value, likely indicating shelf space proportion.

Sales figures vary significantly, indicating diverse product performance.

Outlet characteristics (type, size, location) provide opportunities to analyze sales trends by store category or geography.

Ratings are mostly uniform in this snapshot, so rating-driven insights may be limited.
